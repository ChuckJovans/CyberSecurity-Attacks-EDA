# Exploratory Data Analysis on A ***Cyber Secuity*** Dataset
I carried out EDA on a cybersecurity dataset to be able to to help you assess:
* the heatmaps between different features in the data set,
* The attack signatures on the devices,
* Attack types vs The traffic Types,
* Correlation between the Continous and Catergorical Data
>The above and more was easily done with the help of comprehensive toolkit Known as **Datascrubber**

## Data Scrubber
The Datascrubber module offers a comprehensive toolkit for *preliminary data exploration and cleaning* 💯. With a host of functions to delve into the dataset's details. it serves as a foundational step for any **data analysis or machine learning endeavor** 🧑‍🔬. This tool harnesses the power of *established algorithms 🥇, ingeniously repurposing 🥈 and integrating them to meet the specific objectives of data science 🥉.* By building upon tried-and-true methodologies, **it ensures both reliability and innovation**, offering users a platform that is both grounded in proven techniques and tailored for contemporary data science challenges.
