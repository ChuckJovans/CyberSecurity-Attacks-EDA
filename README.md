# Exploratory Data Analysis on A ***Cyber Secuity*** Dataset
### I carried out EDA on a cybersecurity dataset to be able to to help  assess:
* the heatmaps between different features in the data set,
* the attack signatures on the devices,
* attack types vs The traffic Types,
* correlation between the Continous and Catergorical Data
  
>The above and more was easily done with the help of comprehensive toolkit Known as **Datascrubber**

## [Data Scrubber](https://datascrubber.developerhub.io/data-scrubber)
The Datascrubber module offers a comprehensive toolkit for *preliminary data exploration and cleaning* . With a host of functions to delve into the dataset's details. it serves as a foundational step for any **data analysis or machine learning endeavor**. This tool harnesses the power of *established algorithms ðŸ¥‡, ingeniously repurposing ðŸ¥ˆ and integrating them to meet the specific objectives of data science ðŸ¥‰.* By building upon tried-and-true methodologies, **it ensures both reliability and innovation**, offering users a platform that is both grounded in proven techniques and tailored for contemporary data science challenges.

> You can be able to access the Toolkit through [Data Scrubber](https://datascrubber.developerhub.io/data-scrubber) which also has a detailed explaination on how to use it extensively.  
#### Big thanks to [Muganga Charles](https://github.com/muganga-charles) for intelligently engineering this toolkit 

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Cleaned the Dataset using the data_cleaning() method foung in the datascrubber toolkit(module). It generated a visual after the data cleaning indicating clean data
